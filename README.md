# Auto-Tagging-Support-Tickets-Using-LLM
# Objective:
Automatically tag support tickets into categories using a large language model (LLM).
# Dataset:
Free-text Support Ticket Dataset
# Instructions:
● Use prompt engineering or fine-tuning with an LLM

● Compare zero-shot vs fine-tuned performance

● Apply few-shot learning techniques to improve accuracy

● Output top 3 most probable tags per ticket
# Skills Gained:
● Prompt engineering

● LLM-based text classification

● Zero-shot and few-shot learning

● Multi-class prediction and ranking
